            I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in
            full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very
            enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of
            digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design,
            and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to
            me.

            I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then,
            I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
            challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
            Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web
            development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications
            using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs,
            Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.

            When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering
            around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of
            early startups or enjoying some free time. You can follow me on
            Twitter where I share tech-related bites and build in public, or
            you can follow me on GitHub.
